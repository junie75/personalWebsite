            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              I am a senior Computer Information Systems major at St. Mary's
              University in San Antonio, Texas. Prior to this, I obtained
              Associate's degrees in Business and Biology from Seminole State
              College in Oklahoma. Alongside my academic pursuits, I actively
              engage in various extra-curricular activities. I serve as the
              president of the Black Student Union, am a member of the Society
              of Women Engineers, and contribute as a member of the soccer team
              at my university. I anticipate graduating in May 2024.

            <h2>Skillset</h2>
            <p>
              I am proficient in C/C++, Java, and experienced in designing
              normalized databases in MSSQL Server and SQLite. I also have
              experience utilizing the .NET framework to create a C# GUI that
              performs SQL queries. In one of my favorite projects, I developed
              a Python-like programming language using assembly language
              programming, complemented by a compiler designed in C++. Beyond
              the curriculum, I've self-studied Python, JavaScript, HTML, and
              CSS.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
              I am passionate about the possibilities that programming offers in
              problem-solving, ranging from enhancing the efficiency of simple
              tasks to developing software that can genuinely save lives.
              Presently, I am actively seeking opportunities in Software
              Engineering/Development. My objective is to secure a position
              within a company that is committed to making a positive impact. I
              aspire to work for an organization that shares my values of caring
              for people and aims to make a meaningful difference in the world.
